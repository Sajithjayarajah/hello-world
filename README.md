Brief paragraph about what you would like to accomplish in Web Design. 

In web design, my goal is to create attractive and user-friendly websites that effectively convey a client's message. 
I also want to learn how to organize websites properly by following all the rules. By the end of the course, 
I hope I can create my own web pages with good layouts and structure, following the right guidelines. My ultimate aim 
is to make websites that not only look great but also provide a positive user experience and allow users to accomplish 
their tasks easily.
